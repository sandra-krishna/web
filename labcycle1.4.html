<p><i><b>The Alchemist (Portuguese: O Alquimista) is a novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho which was first published in 1988. 
Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely translated international bestseller.
An allegorical novel, The Alchemist follows a young Andalusian shepherd in his journey to the pyramids of Egypt, after having a recurring dream of finding a
treasure there.The book's main theme is about finding one's destiny, although according to The New York Times, The Alchemist is "more self-help than literature".
The advice given to Santiago that "when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true" is the 
core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays throughout it.</i></b></p>
